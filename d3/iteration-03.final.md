# Table Ready

## Iteration 03

 * Start date: Nov 14th, 2019
 * End date: Nov 31st, 2019

### Changes from you `product.md`

1. Removed subscription and payment related operations from our application.
- We left the payment related implementations to d3 as it is not a very important feature and may be very complicated to implement. 
- After we are done with d2, we discussed with our partner about how she want the payment to be implemented. She said she would not want this feature to be implemented for now as she's worried about the security aspects.
- Since there won't be any real users for this application for some time, she asked us to allocate the time to the main restaurant managing features.
- We also used this extra time to add tests for both server calls and react components, achieving about 80% test coverage covering all of the important functionalities. 

2. Reduced the scope of viewing restaurant table layout. 
- Initially, our partner mentioned that she would like to see the actual table layout on the restaurant management page if we have time.
- We did some research and found out this is a very complicated implementation, so we just implemented the "drag and drop" guests to table operation, which is what she envisioned for the most part. 
- The "drag and drop" is also a quite complicated and important functionality, so we wanted to spend more time on it. 

3. Removed customer related analysis 
- We planned have some customer analysis features for the benefit of restaurant managers, but we learned afterward that the mobile app is still under development and we do not have access to the customer information from our end.
- We asked our partner and she didn't want to include these features yet, so we allocated our time on other more important functionalities.  

### Handoff plan

We will have a handoff meeting with our partner to discuss about the end result of our application and any possible future issues and plans. We will be handing off the codebase, deployment tools, database access and planning documents. These are mostly already owned by our partner as we asked her to register required accounts before we start. 
We've also compiled a summary of the tools we've used and instructions on maintaining them. Our partner told us that she does have a developer team that may be able to help her maintain the product in the future. So we believe providing her access to the codebase, database and the tools we used will be sufficient.
